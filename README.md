# Game-Of-Life
Game Of Life is a Generative Application where the cells of the grid(Canvas) come to life or become dead according to certain rules which are stated as follows:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two neighbors dies.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

This project extensively uses DOM, JavaScript. HTML5 and CSS3 were used for canvas designing.
